.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sieve\-filter
.RI [ options ]
.I script\-file
.I source\-mailbox
.RI [ source\-action ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBsieve\-filter\fP command is part of the Pigeonhole Project
(\fBpigeonhole\fR(7)), which adds Sieve (RFC 5228) support to the Dovecot
secure IMAP and POP3 server (\fBdovecot\fR(1)).
.PP
The Sieve language was originally meant for filtering messages upon delivery. 
However, there are occasions when it is desirable to filter messages that are
already stored in a mailbox, for instance when a bug in a Sieve script caused
many messages to be delivered incorrectly. Using the sieve\-filter tool it is
possible to apply a Sieve script on all messages in a particular mailbox, making
it possible to delete messages, to store them in a different mailbox and to
change the assigned IMAP flags and keywords. Attempts to send messages to the
outside world are ignored by default for obvious reasons, but, using the proper
command line options, it is possible to capture outgoing mail as well. 
.PP
If no options are specified, the sieve\-filter command runs in a simulation mode
in which it only prints what would be performed, without actually doing
anything. Use the \fB\-e\fP option to activate true script execution. Also, the
source mailbox is opened read\-only by default, so that the source mailbox 
remains unchanged. Use the \fB\-W\fP option to allow changes in the source mailbox.
And even with the \fB\-W\fP option enabled, messages in the source mailbox are
only potentially modified and not (re)moved, unless a \fIsource\-action\fP
argument other than \fBkeep\fP is specified.
.SS CAUTION
Although this is a very useful tool, it can also be very destructive when used
improperly. A small bug in your Sieve script in combination with the wrong
command line options could cause it to discard the wrong e\-mails. And, even if
the source mailbox is opened in read\-only mode to prevent such mishaps, it can
still litter other mailboxes with spurious copies of your e\-mails if your Sieve
script decides to do so. Therefore, users are advised to read this manual
carefully and to use the simulation mode first to check what the script will do.
And, of course:

\fBMAKING A BACKUP IS IMPERATIVE FOR ANY IMPORTANT MAIL!\fP

.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-c\  config\-file
Alternative Dovecot configuration file path.
.TP
.B \-C
Force compilation. By default, the compiled binary is stored on disk. When this
binary is found during the next execution of \fBsieve\-filter\fP and its
modification time is more recent than the script file, it is used and the script
is not compiled again. This option forces the script to be compiled, thus
ignoring any present binary. Refer to \fBsievec\fP(1) for more information about
Sieve compilation.
.TP
.B \-D
Enable Sieve debugging.
.TP
.B \-e
Turns on execution mode. By default, the sieve\-filter command runs in
simulation mode in which it changes nothing, meaning that no mailbox is altered
in any way and no actions are performed. It only prints what would be done.
Using this option the sieve\-filter command becomes active and performs the 
requested actions.
.TP
.BI \-m\  default\-mailbox
The mailbox where the (implicit) \fBkeep\fP Sieve action stores messages. This is
equal to the source mailbox by default. 
.TP
.B \-M
Enable move mode. This will cause all messages that were succesfully stored
somewhere else to be expunged from the source mailbox, regardless of what the 
\fIsource\-action\fP is (refer to Arguments section below). However, if the
Sieve filter decides to keep the message in the source mailbox, it is left
there and not affected by this option. 
.IP
Note that some Sieve actions, such as \fBredirect\fP, don't store the message
anywhere and are thus \- with respect to the fate of the message in the source
mailbox \- treated as if a \fBdiscard\fP action were executed. 
.TP
.BI \-q\  output\-mailbox\  \fR[not\ implemented\ yet]\fP
Store outgoing e\-mail into the indicated \fIoutput\-mailbox\fP. By default,
the sieve\-filter command ignores Sieve actions such as redirect, reject,
vacation and notify, but using this option outgoing messages can be appended to
the indicated mailbox. This option has no effect in simulation mode. Flags of
redirected messages are not preserved. 
.TP
.BI \-Q\  mail\-command\  \fR[not\ implemented\ yet]\fP
Send outgoing e\-mail (e.g. as produced by redirect, reject and vacation)
through the specified program. By default, the sieve\-filter command ignores
Sieve actions such as redirect, reject, vacation and notify, but using this
option outgoing messages can be fed to the \fBstdin\fP of an external shell
command. This option has no effect in simulation mode. Unless you really know
what you are doing, \fBDO NOT USE THIS TO FEED MAIL TO SENDMAIL!\fP.
.TP
.BI \-s\  script\-file\  \fR[not\ implemented\ yet]\fP
Specify additional scripts to be executed before the main script. Multiple
\fB\-s\fP arguments are allowed and the specified scripts are executed
sequentially in the order specified at the command
line.
.TP
.BI \-u\  user
Run the Sieve script for the given \fIuser\fP.
.TP
.B \-W
Enables write access to the source mailbox. This allows deleting the messages
from the source mailbox and changing the assigned IMAP flags and keywords. 
.TP
.BI \-x\  extensions
Set the available extensions. The parameter is a space\-separated list of the
active extensions. By prepending the extension identifiers with \fB+\fP or
\fB\-\fP, extensions can be included or excluded relative to the default set of
extensions. If no extensions have a \fB+\fP or \fB\-\fP prefix, only those
extensions that are explicitly listed will be enabled. Unknown extensions are
ignored and a warning is produced. By default, all supported extensions are
available, except for deprecated extensions or those that are still under
development.

For example \fB\-x\fP \(dq+imapflags \-enotify\(dq will enable the deprecated
imapflags extension along with all extensions that are available by default,
except for the enotify extension.

.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I script\-file
Specifies the script to (compile and) execute.

Note that this tool looks for a pre\-compiled binary file with a \fI.svbin\fP
extension and with basename and path identical to the specified script. Use the
\fB\-C\fP option to disable this behavior by forcing the script to be compiled
into a new binary.
.TP
.I source\-mailbox
The name of the source mailbox.
.TP 
.I source\-action
Specifies what is done with messages in the source mailbox once processed by the
Sieve script. The \fIsource\-action\fP parameter accepts one of the following values:
.RS 7
.TP 
.BR keep\  (default)
Keep processed messages in source mailbox. When the filter decides to store the message
in the source mailbox, it is never duplicated there. However, in that case, the
IMAP flags of the original message can be modified by the Sieve interpreter. 
.TP 
.BI move\  mailbox
Move processed messages to the indicated \fImailbox\fP. This is for instance useful
to move messages to a Trash mailbox. 
.TP 
.B delete
Flag processed messages as \\DELETED.
.TP 
.B expunge
Expunge processed messages, meaning that these are removed irreversibly when the
tool finishes filtering.
.RE
.IP
The \fBsource\-action\fP is normally applied to all messages in the source mailbox,
but there are a few exceptions:
.RS 7
.IP \(bu
When the \fB\-W\fP option is not specified, the source mailbox is immutable and
the specified \fIsource\-action\fP has no effect.
.IP \(bu
When the \fB\-M\fR option (move mode) is active, all messages that were
successfully moved to another mailbox are expunged irrespective of the specified 
\fIsource\-action\fP. 
.IP \(bu
If the filter decides to keep the message in the source mailbox, it is left there
and not affected by the \fIsource\-action\fP.
